My application will show users their song collection. 

First, user will sign up an account. 

Then they can add songs and details to their collection to keep them so whenever
they want to find their favorite songs they only need to sign in and the songs 
will show up.

They can setup the songs in whatever category they want to call or whatever order
that they like.

They can login and logout whenever they want.
